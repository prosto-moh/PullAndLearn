# PullAndLearn Telegram Bot

PullAndLearn is a Telegram bot designed to help users learn English technical vocabulary from web pages. It works similarly to Quizlet, but automatically extracts new words from a URL and helps you translate, memorize, and quiz them.

## Features

- **Automatic word extraction**: Extracts English words from any web page.
- **Translation support**: Prepares a prompt for LLM translation from English to Russian.
- **Custom vocabulary management**: Keeps track of words you are learning (`words_in_learning.json`) and words you have already learned (`learned_words.json`).
- **Quizlet-style learning**: Sends words randomly for practice with "Flip card", "Learned", and "Next card" buttons.
- **Technical context**: Prioritizes technical and engineering terms (programming, physics, math, IT) when generating translations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PullAndLearn.git
cd PullAndLearn
````

2. Create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download NLTK data:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')
```

5. Set your Telegram bot token:

Create a file Token.txt and place your token there.

## Usage

1. Start the bot in Telegram:

```bash
python baseline.py
```

2. Use `/start` to begin.
3. Send a URL of the page from which you want to collect words.
4. Copy the prompt generated by the bot and use any LLM to translate the words.
5. Send the resulting JSON back to the bot.
6. Start practicing words with Quizlet-style cards.
